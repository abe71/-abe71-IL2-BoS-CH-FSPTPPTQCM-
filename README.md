CH - products map for IL2 Sturmovik Battle of Stalingrad


This is a repository for one engine aircrafts in IL2-Sturmovik Battle of Stalingrad VR. The CH map makes use of IL2s default settings where ever possible.

The map is based on my old profile for IL2-Forgotten Battles and is still in the early stages of configuration so there are "dead" commands in the .CMC and not all buttons are correctly mapped. The most important functions works though.


In this map I make use of "non sticky modes", the two leftmost fingerbuttons controls which of the 4 modes are active, just like the shift button would do. This is extra great when playing in VR since it is impossible to see the mode indicator on the joysticks.
